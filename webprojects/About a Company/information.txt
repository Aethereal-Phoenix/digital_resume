A consistent color scheme and layout using class/id selectors

Valid code that meets HTML and CSS standards/validates without errors

Design decisions that support accessibility for all user

🧭 Page 1: Company Homepage
Introduce the company and set the design tone.

x-Company name
x-tagline
x-slogan

x-Navigation menu linking to the Product page and back

x-At least one Google Font applied to headings or body text

x-A color theme using HEX or RGB values

x-Pseudo class styles (e.g., :hover) for interactive links or buttons

x-Semantic tags such as <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>

x-Include An <h1> with the product name
x-Each product should appear in its own section and include:

x-An <h2> with the product name

x-A product image

x-A description that wraps around the image using float

x-Spacing/styling using the Box Model (margin, padding, border)

⚠️ Important: Do not float the product sections. Each section should stack vertically. Only the image inside each section should float to allow text to wrap beside it.

🎨 Shared Stylesheet
x-Use a single external CSS file for both pages.

Consider how you will create classes that can be used on both pages to maintain a consistent look and feel.
Example: Use this class on multiple elements across pages for consistency.
